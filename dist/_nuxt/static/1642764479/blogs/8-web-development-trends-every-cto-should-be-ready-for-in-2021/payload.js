For decision-makers, it’s necessary to be acquainted with them to withstand the ever-rising competition among the same industries. Thus, today [IT experts](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FTechnology_specialist) at Vodworks have drafted a piece of complete information about web development trends that will rise in 2021. Let’s take you to the trends that we believe will revolutionize the course of effort for CTO’s in 2021 and these are:\n\n## **Progressive Web Apps**\n\nIt is one of the latest trends in web development and drives the global web headlong – compelling the website browsing experience just like native mobile apps. Concisely, PWA is a website that presents the functionality of native apps like hardware access, sending push notifications, and offline access. Specifically, applications report that 80% of the general time users spent on their gadgets. Here, the PWAs are adept to help in troubleshooting issues like mediocre experience, slowness, and offline access. For building a PWA, you can use Angular, React, or Polymer technology set. Brands like [Alibaba](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FAlibaba_Group), [Forbes](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FForbes), [Twitter](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FTwitter), [Virgin America](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FVirgin_America), and [The Washington Post](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FThe_Washington_Post) are using PWA and indicate a surge in conversions and a reduction in load time.\n\n## **Accelerated Mobile Pages**\n\nGoogle has taken thoughtful steps to enrich the mobile browsing feel. The establishment initially presented Accelerated Mobile Pages in 2015 and currently, it’s one of the modern drifts of web technologies. This technology is shaped to inspire building websites that load immediately and work effortlessly on mobile devices. It takes 2 seconds to load the AMP pages and 22 seconds on the non-AMP pages. [AMP ](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FAccelerated_Mobile_Pages)pages can boost the website’s higher positions in Search Engine Result Pages (SERP) and is also great for boosting SEO. You can use a purpose-built AMP HTML open framework for your project.\n\n## **Responsive Websites**\n\nEven though web development trends for 2021 are being discussed with PWA and AMP – however, you will still find some old-styled responsive web designs. The reason is that previously it wasn’t important to have a responsive design – but now it is a must. This is because of the shift in technology. Now, the majority of the users prefer a mobile phone over a desktop. Due to this shift, [Google ](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FGoogle)has started mobile-first indexing. Indicating, that your website will only rank if you’ve it well-optimized for mobile devices.\n\n## **Voice Search Optimization**\n\nRendering to [Gartner](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.gartner.com\u002Fen), 30% of searches in 2021 will be done without a screen. Studies suggest that 21.4 million smart speakers will be in the US alone by 2021. Subsequently, by 2022 voice commerce sales will increase by $5 billion in the UK and $40 billion in the US alone. Therefore, rendering to these studies and the actual market condition – voice search optimization is a drift CTO’s cannot miss. It should be a part of your SEO and tech stack – furthermore, Voice data can have the web Speech API as well. The API is separated into two elements: speech recognition and synthesis. Speech recognition is used for voice framework and replies to inquiries. Whereas, speech synthesis is a text-to-speech module that lets scripts deliver content.\n\n## **API-First Development**\n\nRecent trends propose that web solutions need to connect easily with every application. This is mainly because of the rise of numerous wearables, mobiles, and much more. The integration has to be seamless, and devices should integrate with each other easily. This is where you will require to focus on an API-first development. For building an [API-first design](https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fbetter-practices\u002Fapi-first-software-development-for-modern-organizations-fdbfba9a66d3) you can use [Swagger ](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FSwagger_(software))or API Blueprint.\n\n## **Push Notifications**\n\nIt is a powerful tool for augmenting the user experience and advertising efforts of your business. Traditionally, mobile apps have strong and supple aptitudes for user notifications – conversely, the web apps gain incentive here too. Furthermore, push notifications applied on web apps are used for delivering updates like the latest blog post, recent changes, or out-of-stock notifications, etc. There are abundant solutions to use when you want to build browser push notifications such as [OneSignal](https:\u002F\u002Fonesignal.com\u002F), [PushEngage](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.crunchbase.com\u002Forganization\u002Fpushengage),[ ZoPush](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.zopush.com\u002Fcontact-us), and [PushCrew](https:\u002F\u002Fvwo.com\u002Fengage\u002F?ref=pc). \n\n## **AI-Driven Chatbots**\n\nThis technology is useful for businesses that work around the clock and in various time zones. The purpose is to offer seamless customer support without compromising on the quality or unavailability of staff in odd hours. However, because of the shift in the web development trends now you can offer automated, and seamless client support 24\u002F7. [Chatbots ](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FChatbot)that are driven by [AI](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FArtificial_intelligence) and machine learning have proven to be a laudable asset for this functionality.
