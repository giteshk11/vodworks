[PHP](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FPHP)\n\nLet’s discuss these in detail below:\n\n## **Python**\n\nPython is the fastest-growing, general-purpose, high-level programming language with an emphasis on code legibility. It is famous in the fields of Data Science, Statistics, Analytics, ML, and AI. It has competition with R only. Frameworks like [Django](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FDjango_(web_framework)), Pyramid, and [Turbo Gear](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FTurboGears) are feature-packed and easy to learn. Popular companies like [Qualcomm](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FQualcomm), [Cisco](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FCisco_Systems), [Google](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FGoogle), [IBM](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FIBM), [Mozilla](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FFirefox), [Quora](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FQuora), [HP](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FHewlett-Packard), and [Dropbox ](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FDropbox_(service))use it.\n\n## **JavaScript**\n\nThe Internet was built with JavaScript, [HTML](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FHTML), and CSS programming languages. Generally branded as the language of web developers, it is a feature-rich, object-initiated scripting language. Highlighting asynchronous event management and crispy syntax, it presents extensive use for web development. It features multiple frameworks for backend and frontend development. You get a lot of supporting technologies like JSON, jQuery, Angular, and React linked to JavaScript. Tech giants like Facebook, SAP, Google, [Dell](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FDell), and [Accenture ](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FAccenture)rely on JavaScript to plan interactive web pages and dynamically display content to users.\n\n## **Java**\n\nJava is held by the Oracle Corporation. It is one of the original, most common, in-need languages. Web development companies like to use it because of its individuality from platforms. It is famous for its scalability and portability around numerous platforms from mainframe data hubs to smartphones. Its influential features consist of robust memory managing, high performance, and top-notch security. Java is present in almost 3 billion devices, and roughly 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies use it. Spring, Struts, and Hibernate all are Java-based famous frameworks. It is used in mobile applications, web development, system programming, and big data development.\n\n## **C++**\n\nIt is the pioneer of programming languages, and a sequel to C. Furthermore, it is a high-performance language used in developing performance-critical applications. Mobile apps, game development, and scripting – all rely on C++. Additionally, you can use frameworks and libraries like [Wx-Widgets](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FWxWidgets), [GTK++](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FGTK), boost, and [Qt](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FQt_(software)). It was used to create [Microsoft Windows](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FMicrosoft_Windows) and Google Chrome. Applications like Adobe Photoshop, Google Chromium, MapReduce, Mozilla Firefox, and MySQL database – all use it.\n\n## **GoLang**\n\nThe tech giant Google developed it. It is used to create productive, simple, and secure software. It is an open-source language with functional and object-based programming. GoLang is used to develop [Kubernetes](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FKubernetes), Hugo, Docker, Hyperledger Blockchain, and Ethereum. Walmart, Springboard, Siemens, and Dell use it.\n\n## **C#**\n\nFormed by Microsoft, C# is one of the most significant programming languages in the Dot NET framework. Its comprehensive programming foundation applies to PHP, Java, and Objective-C. Big websites like Bing, Dell, Visual Studio, and Market Watch use it to handle their backend operations. It is best for apps that are iOS, Android, and Windows-based. Developers also recommend it for building 2D and 3D video games.\n\n## **SQL**\n\nStructured Query Language is used to interact with databases. It examines and understands databases containing fields of data around tables. Numerous Fortune 500 companies have built their high-feat database structures, with SQL to query data and complete evaluation. Uber, Netflix, Airbnb, Google, and Amazon utilize SQL as their initial probing method.\n\n## **Dart**\n\nThis language is also developed by Google. It is an iterative, open-source, browser-and-server-side programming language. It allows code sharing and developing a single application for both Android and iOS platforms.  Just like Flutter, Dart is famous within organizations like Motorola, Airbnb, Google, Apple, and HP.\n\n## **R**\n\nThe “Lingua franca of statistics” is devised by statisticians and is purpose-built for statistical computation. Due to massive data research and collection – R is used by organizations to analyze data. It is a cross-platform, open-source language. It is also used to build interactive web apps. Giants like Mu Sigma, Google, and Twitter use it.\n\n## **PHP**\n\nAlmost 79% of all the [websites ](https:\u002F\u002Fvodworks.com\u002Fblog\u002F)with server-side programming language use it. It is largely sourced for developing lively and data-hefty sites and apps. It is a fast, general-purpose, and platform-independent programming language. Techies like Facebook, Yahoo, and Wikipedia use PHP programming language.",component:"blog",read_time:"2",description:"Nowadays, with the development of AI, automation, ML, and Blockchain the world is getting smarter by the day.
