They want to create a tool that helps in completing day-to-day tasks quickly and efficiently. And, here a good enterprise [UX design](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FUser_experience_design) can be handy. However, the enterprise UX design is complicated and complex as compared to the usual UX. As they all aim to create a tool that allows executing everyday tasks quickly and precisely. It has to draw problems and restraints you may never see in customer-fronting UX. Therefore, today we’re explaining enterprise UX, and how you can build it.\n\n## **What Is Enterprise UX Design?**\n\nBeing design-driven is a common entity within the most pioneering tech companies around the globe. The enterprise UX design is related to creating a user experience for applications to systematize business procedures within big enterprises. In short, it’s a [software ](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FSoftware)put together specifically for an establishment’s staff.\n\nFurthermore, an enterprise UX design is an evolved necessity with each passing year and doesn’t stop getting better. Nowadays, large-size corporations know that a striking enterprise app design helps their employees to get the job done quickly, and generate good revenue. In addition, companies that produce [B2B solutions](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FBusiness-to-business) have to maintain high design standards. Or they won’t be in demand, and neither will their product. \n\n## **How To Create Top-Notch Enterprise UX?**\n\nIf you work around UX design then you’ll know how this combination can be useful. You have to combine a good-looking and easy-to-use solution with complex business processes. And, with an enterprise UX design, this is the main challenge. A lot of companies also use this approach for creating user-friendly enterprise mobile application designs. Therefore, we’ve created the below step-by-step formula to build a great enterprise UX design solution. These are:\n\n* Core Values\n* Target Audiences\n* Refine The UX\n\n## **Focus On The Core Needs Of An Enterprise**\n\nEvery single piece of software is built to untangle specific problems. And you can’t forecast the technical hitches in the following UX design venture. Still, each enterprise software has certain common traits, these are:\n\n* **Data Frame –** Behind the interface of the software, you’ll always find a data frame. They are complicated based on the software specificity and comprise of distinct challenges or traits or limitations with certain actions. In addition, they have numerous layers that make a structure that intricate work.\n* **User-Based Customization & Network –** Every software solution has customization for specific users’ requirements. After all, they won’t acquire numerous services for finishing one task. The system may need networking with numerous suites, merchants, or products in enterprise software. It’s like an environment formed by [Google ](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FGoogle)or Apple where gadgets and accounts synchronize but is considerably a trickier one.\n* **Sales Conduit –** With [cloud-based software](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FCloud_computing) for businesses, you should think across all hitches in handling sales activities. Discuss this initially with the support staff and sales representatives. And next, clarify the tech requirements to the developers.\n\n## **Study The Target Audience**\n\nA refined UX will always transpire great results for an organization. And, departments like the product team, marketing section, and operations do take the full reward. The better the UX, the advance the outreach and user experience. This whole procedure will further course better revenue along with a strong brand image. Furthermore, this implementation is also going to help the staff to handle more complex processes within minutes and also cater to every customer need individually. This will help your business to solve minor issues with cost-effective solutions and also generate more revenue. The rescue is user enterprise UX as it will offer customers self-service selections or automate the process for long-term success.\n\n**Refine The UX Design**\n\nWith digital transformation, your customers will be loyal to only digital products. However, with an enterprise[ UX design](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FUser_experience_design), this tends to be a bit complex. You will need a design ladder to measure the design efficiently. This will help you in establishing goals and reach the next level of progress with the design. Don’t opt for inexpensive or ready-made solutions. If you build your own software product, you will have better options to customize and attain high-level satisfaction among staff. Your employees will display better productivity, and retain good KPIs with a good design.\n\n### **Comprehending The UX Process Of Enterprise Software**\n\nA seamless UX design is going to make your staff happy. The smooth the software is the easier the tasks will be solved. Thus, employ a meaningful design to fine-tune processes and give your employees an extra hand for high-level workflow. Evaluate the amount of determination it takes to grasp an idea. Measure the impact on users’ needs and the company’s requirements. Try to automate the day-to-day tasks by getting involved with your staff. Do a detailed analysis to share ideas with an expert UI\u002FUX designer. This will allow them to envision a well-thought enterprise UX design. \n\n## **Time To Get To Work**\n\nOnce you identify the needs, an idea can be formed immediately to start the process. Set up goals based on your business-specific requirements to create a great and unified enterprise UX design. Product & service innovations are possible when you minimize redundancies and increase efficiencies with the right systems. Elevating every decision with #BI leads to enhanced productivity & efficiency. Learn how to get your organization future-ready.

At the moment, some sites still use this method. We create a mobile site for users with cell phones and point the rest to the primary desktop view. Now cellphones are “smarter,” thus two new methods to design for small and large screens got developed — these are adaptive and responsive designs.\n\n## **History Of Design Elements**\n\nResponsive Design is largely attributed to Ethan Marcotte. The credit for the term Adaptive Design goes to [Aaron Gustafson](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FAdaptive_web_design) who inscribed a book called Adaptive Design. Another term used for mobile design is called “Mobile First.” [Luke Wroblewski](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.lukew.com\u002F) earns credit for the label Mobile First. It means designing the mobile adaptation of a site before you design the bigger, desktop edition. In general, most sites were planned with the desktop version first.\n\n## **What Is Adaptive Design?**\n\nIt was developed to meet the various needs of a rising number of cell phones with diverse abilities and screen proportions. You need to create numerous adaptations of each web page and install complex programming on your web server that perceives each gadget and distributes a version of the site augmented for the cell phone screen size. Adaptive design is complex, exclusive, and usually used only by large, well-funded websites.\n\n## **What Is Responsive Design?**\n\nLuckily, responsive design is speedily gaining support. With responsive design, you make one web page and then use numerous arrangements of CSS rules to modify the format and design built on the dimensions of the browser window.\n\n## **Anything Common Between Them?**\n\nBoth of these web designs are fundamentally about creating web designs that are enhanced for the dimensions of the screen or the kind of device that is worked to view them. The rudimentary concept is that you make a website that functions on numerous screen sizes.  In short to easily work best on three different screen sizes — a small-scale mobile screen, a tablet-sized display, and a larger desktop.\n\n## **What’s The Main Difference Between?**\n\nResponsive designs counter to variations in the width of a browser window by altering the position of elements on a web page to easily fit any space. Therefore, as you linger on the browser to make it bigger or smaller, you’ll see the design adjust in real-time. Visit that site on an [iPhone](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.apple.com\u002Fiphone\u002F), iPad, and you will notice that the design is besieged to fit the size of the device.\n\nWhereas, adaptive designs use an urbane auto-detection cursive on the webserver to recognize each device and then distribute the best adaptation of the site. Consequently, the site doesn’t alter if you drag the browser. Nevertheless, if you see the site from different mobile devices, you’ll notice unique designs and content as with adaptive design you can have entirely different varieties of content and design.\n\n## **Why Choose Responsive Over Adaptive Design?**\n\nThe reason is simple. Adaptive design is tough and costly. Whereas, responsive design is the latest development and is operating [CSS media queries](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FMedia_queries). It is also not used by old or inadequate mobile phones. If you’re working on an extremely developed website, which has to be interactive, and a secure site – then you have to make an adaptive design. In an ideal world, you also need to have a huge team of developers and finances.\n\nA lot of designers are selecting responsive design nowadays. Not only because it’s economical and undemanding. Furthermore, it’s well-organized to make one design that fine-tunes to various screen sizes of current and upcoming devices as well. Soon websites will be displayed on giant television screens, so it’s not only phones, tablets, laptops, or desktops anymore. Very soon we’ll be browsing with Google’s new glasses – [Google Glass](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.google.com\u002Fglass\u002Fstart\u002F), and many more such inventions.\n\n## **But, What About Folks Using Old Mobiles?**\n\nIt’s fateful that responsive websites don’t exert on truly old or limited cell phones. Furthermore, if your business focuses on emerging markets like [Asia](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FAsia), [Africa](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FAfrica), or [Latin America](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FLatin_America) – then you do have to think. Therefore, you have to create an adaptive website if you have reserves. If you can’t – then think of designing one simple mobile-responsive site. You’ll have to curb the features, but at best it will be reachable to everyone in your viewers. If you’re designing websites for more developed markets then responsive design is the ideal choice.\n\nWhatever you chose, it better resonates with your business goals.

However, they do have a difference. These two different methods belong to the modern challenge of designing web pages operating on small and big screens.  In the world of web design, the only thing tougher than HTML, CSS is maintaining the jargon. This blog is about helping you grasp what responsive and adaptive design include, and how these methods are different.",2602439,"https:\u002F\u002Fa.storyblok.com\u002Ff\u002F110872\u002F400x250\u002Fc0ba077e9d\u002Fmobile-first-web-design-400x250.jpg","2021-05-06 00:00","\u003C!--#storyblok#{\"name\": \"blog\", \"space\": \"110872\", \"uid\": \"fc2faf38-f4a8-45a8-b4e6-5b346aea359a\", \"id\": \"61926146\"}--\u003E","how-mobile-first-web-design-is-different-from-adaptive-and-responsive","blogs\u002Fhow-mobile-first-web-design-is-different-from-adaptive-and-responsive","Web Pages","Responsive","Mobile-first Web Design","adaptive","39ed0613-ca65-45dd-bcf0-5196eda5c312","2021-07-21T17:34:15.000Z","2021-07-20T04:08:11.455Z","2021-07-22T12:19:28.911Z",61566573,"ce238067-35e0-420b-960d-0c5336a9405a","eee27d0e-f26e-4914-897e-970b20d4ed14","If you want your product or mobile app to be famous – then you have to pay attention to providing a good design based on [user experience (UX)](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FUser_experience) and [user interface (UI)](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FUser_interface_design). A striking interface prompts the user to install your app. Stylish UX design will let the users connect with your business. Furthermore, you will get strong app engagement, customer loyalty, and retention.\n\nIf the app’s design helps to convert users into long-term customers – then it’s helping the business to succeed and remain competitive. Companies know that developing a high-level [mobile app](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FMobile_app) design is of great value. Nevertheless, the costs involved will still stand as an important question. Thus, let’s tell you how much it is going to cost to build a good mobile app design.\n\n## **Design Process Length**\n\nThe more the traits, the lengthier it will take to design. And, the more it will cost. Furthermore, the design length also depends on:\n\n* Complexity\n* Cross-platform, progressive web app\n* Native Android or iOS app\n* Company-specific needs\n* Prototype\n* Designers’ expertise and skills\n* Business Specific Requirements\n\nA business has to design an app based on users’ requirements and goals. The designer has to understand that the app design has to have user and company requirements, and industry-based competitor analysis. Remember, your niche competition will play an important role in the design process.\n\nThe user-flow illustrations for every screen show the app’s functionality. The number and intricacy of screens focus on the functionality of the mobile app. Thus, the extra screens an app has, the more the designer will have to work and will impact costs.\n\n## **UX Design & Prototyping**\n\nNow the designer will need to focus on user interaction. The easy-to-use navigation, mobile usability, general app esthetics, and features that can intrigue the user – all fall under this step. For this role, only a certified [UI\u002FUX designer](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.springboard.com\u002Flibrary\u002Fui-ux-design\u002Fskills\u002F) is hired with platform-specific expertise. They will focus on wireframes, sketches, buttons, labels, and many other such features.\n\n## **The Start To End Phase**\n\nThe prototype needs user testing to ensure that the app is competent enough to be deployed. The [QA team](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FQuality_assurance) will need to ensure that the application is error and bug-free. Furthermore, the prototype will also be tested for platform specifications and user interactions. Some of you may feel that prototype testing is unnecessary. However, this step helps in saving time and costs. This testing phase allows the identification of the essential components and helps to modify the product while saving funds. \n\n## **Platforms Impact Costs**\n\nIt is a major cost-defining factor. Every operating system has a set of rules which certify the interface appears and looks like the OS. [iOS ](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FIOS)or [Android](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FAndroid_(operating_system)) devices have separate OS, and the designer should be conversant about the [Apple Store](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FApple_Inc.) or [Play Store](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FGoogle_Play) design procedures. The designer can be pixel-perfect for a limited range of iOS devices. But, for Android, it will be difficult because there are a lot of devices and the OS is also fragmented.\n\n## **User Interface Design**\n\nThe creative experience of the designer is based on the unique visuals and styles that come in from a seamless market understanding. The deliverables around design include interactive patterns, unique color schemes, and shapes. For a native user interface design, you have to follow the mobile platform guidelines.\n\nA custom UI is formed from scrape via unique styles, graphic elements, and non-typical UI essentials to look more attractive and exclusive. Therefore, a modified app design will be ready in about 100 hours than a [native app design](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FMobile_app_development). If you may need some animation or an additional set of icons – the cost will increase.\n\n## **Designers Toolkit Also Add To The Cost**\n\nTo create a mockup the designer will use various tools. Normally a sketch it’s used to do the needful. If you’re looking to get the application to be ready – then you’ll need to have a project-based setup with an IT company. This will involve project managers, a QA team, expert UI\u002FUX designers, and [platform-specific developers](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FCross-platform_software). This team of experts will work on design, build, test, and then later release your mobile app on Google Play Store or Apples’ App Store. \n\n## **Closing Thoughts** \n\nThe below estimation is for an [MVP](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FMinimum_viable_product) – a minimum viable product for one platform.\n\n**Task                                                                        Estimated time to complete**\n\nCompetitive analysis and user research                                      20-40 hours  \nUser experience design and prototyping                                      60-100 hours  \nUser interface design                                                                          50-80 hours  \nApp logo and icon design                                                                   20-30 hours  \nTotal                                                                                                 154-300 hours\n\nThe designer will still work after the deployment of the application. Various feedbacks, bugs, or technology requirements may come in. Thus, the usability testing will continue if new updates or requirements are requested by the users.\n\nIf you’re looking to design a market-competitive mobile app – you can hire expert developers and designers from Team Vodworks.
